### About Me

Hi i'm nik a 3rd year computer science student at Ryerson University with an interest in robotics, machine learning, computer vision and creating visual simulations.

### Currently Learning

my current semester course load consists of 
  - database systems (SQL)
  - computer security (C)
  - intro to artificial intelligence (Prolog)

### Currently Working On

After briefly using pygame for an aspect of a shool project I have begun to attempt to make a 2D pixel art game using the graphics library for fun. Using pygame and python I am trying to create a game framework that allows me to easily add new features to the game as well as allow me to more easily create future games.
