### About Me

Hi i'm Nik,

A 3rd year computer science student minoring in math at Ryerson University with an interest in robotics, machine learning, computer vision and creating visual simulations (visual effects, physics simulations, visualized algorithms etc...).

### Currently Learning

my current semester course load consists of 
  - database systems (SQL)
  - computer security (C)
  - intro to artificial intelligence (Prolog)
  - machine learning (Python)
  - intro to computer vision (MATLAB)

### Current Personal Projects

After a brief introduction to pygame for a shool project and a wave of nostalgia for old flash games I wanted to make one. For the game I decided on a 2D pixel art style. Using pygame and python I am trying to create a game framework that allows me to easily add new features to the game as well as allow me to more easily create future games.
